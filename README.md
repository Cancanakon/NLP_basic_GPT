# NLP_basic_GPT

It involves running the gpt-2 model prepared with OpenAi datasets in its simplest form. Dataset is downloaded automatically and can work integratedly. Fine-Tuning can be done optionally with appropriate datasets. It should be reminded again that these codes are published for educational purposes and only work with ready-made GPT-2 datasets, free of charge. You can ensure appropriate accuracy with various adjustments at your own discretion. Additionally, I added the translation algorithm for this algorithm that does not have Turkish language support. Enjoy :)
